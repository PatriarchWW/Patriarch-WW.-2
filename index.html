      "Very professional, knowledgeable, affordable and most importantly honest! I highly recommend Patriarch water works to anyone with a RO system! Had been very disappointed by two other RO companies, who had been dishonest and trying to make us pay unnecessary fees, so it has been such a relief to be able to find Patriarch Water Works. Chris was able to find solutions and work with us with transparency and fix the issues."
